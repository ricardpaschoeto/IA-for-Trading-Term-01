# P01 - Trading with Momentum Project

In this project, we will learn to implement a trading strategy on your own, and test to see if it has the potential to be profitable. You will be supplied with a universe of stocks and time range. You will also be provided with a textual description of how to generate a trading signal based on a momentum indicator. You will then compute the signal for the time range given and apply it to the dataset to produce projected returns. Finally, you will perform a statistical test on the mean of the returns to conclude if there is alpha in the signal. For the dataset, we'll be using the end of day from Quotemedia.

# P02 - Breakout Strategy Project

In this project, we will implement the breakout strategy. You'll find and remove any outliers. You'll test to see if it has the potential to be profitable using a Histogram and P-Value. For the dataset, we'll be using the end of day from Quotemedia.

# P03 - Smart Beta and Portfolio Optimization

In this project, we will build a smart beta portfolio and compare it to a benchmark index. To find out how well the smart beta portfolio did, you’ll calculate the tracking error against the index. You’ll then build a portfolio by using quadratic programming to optimize the weights. Your code will rebalance this portfolio and calculate turn over to evaluate the performance. You’ll use this metric to find the optimal rebalancing Frequency. For the dataset, we'll be using the end of day from Quotemedia.

# P03 - Multi-factor Model

In this project, we will build a statistical risk model using PCA. You’ll use this model to build a portfolio along with 5 alpha factors. You’ll create these factors, then evaluate them using factor-weighted returns, quantile analysis, sharpe ratio, and turnover analysis. At the end of the project, you’ll optimize the portfolio using the risk model and factors using multiple optimization formulations. For the dataset, we'll be using the end of day from Quotemedia and sector data from Sharadar.
